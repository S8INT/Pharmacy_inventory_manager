        <h2>About PharmaTrack</h2>
        <p>PharmaTrack was born out of a personal experience that profoundly impacted our team. A few years ago, one of our family members got a jobas a pharmacist, and always ranted how managing their inventory became a daily challenge. he explained how most pharmacies, struggled with stockouts, and often faced confusion due to inaccurate inventory records. It is always stressful, andhow i came to realize there has to be a better way to manage pharmacy inventory efficiently.</p>
        <p>Driven by this experience, I embarked on a journey to create PharmaTrackâ€”a comprehensive solution to streamline pharmacy inventory management. Becuase why not, this is why i joined ALX. So I poured my knowlegde and skills into developing a user-friendly platform that empowers pharmacists to focus on patient care rather than inventory hassles.</p>
        <h3>Meet the Team</h3>
	<p>This was a solo project, however, advice and consultations were all in handy to make sure i meet my target</p>
